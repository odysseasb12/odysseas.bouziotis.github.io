An in depth-exploration and comparison of the five versions of YOLOv5 namely, YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x. The project gives detailed information on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and how they operate to detect objects and features in an image. A model was developed to test which YOLOv5 version fits best smaller data sets taking into consideration the computational time and accuracy of the detections.
