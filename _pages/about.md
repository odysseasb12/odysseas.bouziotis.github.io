My name is Odysseas Bouziotis and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester.

I am studying MSc Robotics and expected to graduate in December of 2024 (Course completion in September of 2024).

I have a strong desire to enhance my knowledge in Computer Vision, Autonomous Systems, Machine Learning (ML), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Object Detection. 
I have a solid background in programming languages such as Python, C, and Matlab.

More About Me
======

In July 2023 I graduated with honours from the University of Birmingham.

There I undertook a 3-years course in Mechanical Engineering (BEng).

I achieved a first with an overall GPA of 3.75 or 70% and particularly exceeded in modules such as the Engineering Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Design, Integrated Design Projects, and Computational Fluid Dynamics modules as well as my thesis. 

The title of my thesis was "Robotics for Medical Device Inspection". As part of my project I had to deploy an object detection model to detect the different components of a stairlift device (medical component). For the development of the model I created a custom dataset and used Roboflow to make it more robust by annotating components, using augmentation techniques and perform further image processing. The algorithm implemented to train the model was YOLOv5.   

In the summer of 2023 I gladly joined the family of "Switch On Ltd" to gain experience under a 5-week internship program. In my short stay there, I was part of a small group to cover all the electrical connections needed in a 20MW solar farm located close to Blandford Forum south of the UK.   

I am also very passionate about sports. From a very young age I joined a football academy at my hometwon where I played for more than 5 years. At my teenage years, I transitioned to basketball where I competed in the school's league which rewarded me with unforgettable memories. Finally, I continued my basketball journey at the University of Birmingham where as team we managed to qualify in the 3rd division of the BUCS league.
