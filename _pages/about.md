My name is Odysseas Bouziotis and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester.

I am studying MSc Robotics and expected to finish in September 2024.

I am particularly interested in programming languages such as Python, C, and Matlab while I am also fascinated in Machine Learning, Object Detection Techniques, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

More About Me
======

In July 2023 I graduated with honours from the University of Birmingham 

My undergraduate degree was on Mechanical Enginnering 

I achieved a first with an overall GPA of 3.75 or 70% and particularly exceeded in the Engineering Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Design, Integrated Design Projects, and Computational Fluid Dynamics modules as well as my thesis. 

My thesis was on Robotics for Medical Device Inspection, where I deployed an object detection model to successfully detect the different components of a stairlift device. For the deployment of my model I acquired a data set and trained it using Roboflow while also I implemented the YOLOv5 algorithm. 

I also undertook in field working experience on a 20MW solar farm as part of my summer internship.  

I am also passionate about sports. I have played basketball for more than 7 years where I participated in the Birmingham's University Team managing to win the league.
