My name is Odysseas Bouziotis and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester.

I am currently studying MSc Robotics and expected to graduate in December 2024 (Course completion in September 2024).

I am a proactive engineer that constantly seeks new challenges to grow both as a person and as a professional. 
I have a strong desire to enhance my knowledge in Computer Vision, Autonomous Systems, Machine Learning (ML), 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Object Detection. 

More About Me
======

In July 2023 I graduated with honours from the University of Birmingham.

I Completed the Mechanical Engineering (BEng) degree programme.

Achieved a first class grade with an overall GPA of 3.75 or 70%.
Particularly exceeded in modules such as:
Engineering Mathematics, Electrical Engineering,
Mechanical Design, Integrated Design Projects,
and Computational Fluid Dynamics.

The title of my thesis was "Robotics for Medical Device Inspection". As part of my project I had to deploy an object detection model to detect the different components of a stairlift device (medical component). For the development of the model I created a custom dataset and used Roboflow to make it more robust by annotating components, using augmentation techniques and perform further image processing. The algorithm implemented to train the model was YOLOv5.

In the summer of 2023 I joined the family of "Switch On Ltd" to gain experience under a 5-week internship program. 
In my short stay there, I was part of a small group to cover all the electrical connections needed in a 20MW solar farm.

I am also very passionate about sports. From a very young age I joined a football academy at my hometwon where I played for more than 5 years. At my teenage years, I transitioned to basketball and competed in my school's local league. Finally, I continued my basketball journey at the University of Birmingham where we managed to qualify in the next division of the BUCS league for two consecutive years.
